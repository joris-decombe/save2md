## Detailed description

Save2MD converts any web page into a clean, readable Markdown file — perfect for note-taking, archiving, or feeding content to LLMs and AI tools.

**How it works:**
- Click the toolbar icon or right-click anywhere on the page
- Save2MD automatically finds the main content, strips ads, cookie banners, navigation, and other clutter
- Downloads a well-formatted .md file with headings, lists, tables, code blocks, and links preserved

**Features:**
- One-click save from the popup or context menu
- Smart content detection — finds the article body automatically
- Ad and junk removal — strips ads, cookie banners, social widgets, and tracking elements
- Full Markdown support — headings, bold/italic, links, images, lists, blockquotes, tables, and code blocks with syntax hints
- Optional image references — include image URLs or embed as data URIs
- Relative URLs resolved to absolute — links and images always point to the right place
- Clean filenames — page title becomes the filename, sanitized for all operating systems
- Lightweight — no external services, no tracking, everything runs locally

**Great for:**
- Saving articles, documentation, and tutorials for offline reading
- Building a personal knowledge base in Markdown
- Preparing web content for use with AI/LLM tools
- Archiving pages before they disappear
- Distraction-free reading
